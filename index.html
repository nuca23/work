       <div><h1>Why do we use it?</h1></div><div><p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be<br> distracted by the readable content of a page<br> when looking at its layout. The point of using<br> Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal<br> distribution of letters, as opposed to using<br> 'Content here, content here', making it look like<br> readable English. Many desktop publishing<br> packages and web page editors now use Lorem<br> Ipsum as their default model text, and a search<br> for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still<br> in their infancy. Various versions have evolved<br> over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br> like).</p></div><br>
